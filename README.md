# Two-Axis Telescope Control System

The system is based on KL05Z, 2x DRV8834 stepper drivers and 2x Nema 17 42HM34-0606 motors. <br />
It performs very basic functions such as compensation of Earth rotation movement and x8 movement in declination and right ascension axis. <br />
Documentation is written in Polish, but I will add english version soon.
